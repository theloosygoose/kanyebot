"Dark Fantasy"

[Nicki Minaj:]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't
The real one's far too mean
The watered-down one
The one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fiction
Sick addiction
Well gather round children
Zip it
Listen
[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise
[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Kanye West and Bon Iver:]
At the mall there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 


"Gorgeous"
(feat. Kid Cudi & Raekwon)

[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Kanye West:]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?
[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Kanye West:]
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shooting a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fish stick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it
[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Kanye West:]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get into school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool."
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news."
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My God said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls
[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Raekwon:]
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one Ls
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
[Kid Cudi:]
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down 


"Power"
(feat. Dwele)

Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, hey, hey
I'm living in the 21st century doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
21st century schizoid man
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rollin',
Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'
With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world I'll see you in the mornin',
Huh? I'll see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment.
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin'. I just count the hours
Stop trippin'. I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
21st century schizoid man
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my ass hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes!
You short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian,
My ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking...
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
21st century schizoid man
[Verse 3]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation
At the end of the day goddamn it I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well ya'll feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't got a power trip who you going home with?
How 'Ye doin'? I'm surviving
I was drinkin' earlier now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'...
Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey
Hey, hey
[3x]
Now this'll be a beautiful death
[Dwele:]
I'm jumping out the window
I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
You got the power to let power flow
[Ad-lib]
21st century schizoid man

MJ gone, our nigga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way heading up the stairs
To my surprise a nigga replacing me

Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby, please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

"Monster"
(feat. Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Bon Iver & Nicki Minaj)

[Bon Iver:]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
[Rick Ross:]
Bitch I'm a monster no good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
[Kanye West:]
Gossip gossip
Nigga just stop it
Everybody know (I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands...
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gon' do now?"
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
[Kanye West:]
Gossip gossip
Nigga just stop it
Everybody know (I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands...
[Jay-Z:]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong
Loch Ness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question what do these things all have in common
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles
I kill a block I murder the avenues
I rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles' heel is
Love I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these niggas I've made millionaires
Milling about, spilling their feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
[Kanye West:]
Gossip gossip
Nigga just stop it
Everybody know (I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands...
[Nicki Minaj:]
Pull up in the monster
Automobile gangster
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, colour of Willy Wonka
You could be the King but watch the Queen conquer
OK first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
Let me get this straight wait I'm the rookie
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out!
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a middle eastern climate
Violent Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it
While it, Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake
She on a diet but my pockets eating cheese cake
And I'll say Bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give em whiplash
I think big get cash make em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster!
[Bon Iver:]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home 


"So Appalled"
(feat. RZA, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Swizz Beatz & Cyhi the Prynce)

[Swizz Beatz:]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Kanye West:]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous
[Jay-Z:]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30
Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous
[Kanye West:]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous
[Pusha T:]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah
[Swizz Beatz:]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Cyhi The Prynce:]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron
[RZA:]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
[Swizz Beatz:]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous 


"Devil In A New Dress"

[Kanye West:]
I love it though
I love it though, you know
Uh put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us
May the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians make brash decisions
Oh she do it, what happened to Religion?
Oh she lose it
She putting on her make-up
She casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a Jumbotron
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway, oh I forgot it's summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan (Satan, Satan, Satan)
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down it's the magic hour
The magic hour
And outta all the colours that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said, "You are what you eat."
You see I always loved that sense of humour
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme" not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me could you be more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
Haven't said a word,
Haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
[Rick Ross:]
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', runnin' signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps 


"Runaway"
(feat. Pusha T)

[Kanye West:]
Look at you [14x]
Look at you [8x]
Ladies and gentlemen, la-ladies and gentlemen
And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,

Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'd never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick.
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit.
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hood rats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
And I always find
Yeah, I always find,
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,

Baby I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
[Pusha T:]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it
All right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knock-offs, ha, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over Mai Tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
[Kanye:]
Never was much of a romantic,
I could never take the intimacy.
And I know I did damage,
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me,
I guess you knew in an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything.
And I don't know how I'mma manage,
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'd never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can 


"Hell Of A Life"

I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bitter-sweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what!
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes, huh!
Well, I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me,
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams,
Never in your wildest dreams
In your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams,
Comin' from inside the screen
You a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lot of niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me,
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away."
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on?
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me,
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life 


"Blame Game"
(feat. John Legend)

[Kanye West:]
Whose fault?
[John Legend:]
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more.
Let's call out names, names, for sure.
I'll call you bitch for short as a last resort and my first resort.
You call me motherfucker for long,
At the end of it you know we both were wrong.
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more.
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more.
Let's call out names, names, for sure.
[Kanye West:]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else."
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings, yo I'd rather be by my fucking self
'Til about 2 AM and I call back and I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
[John Legend:]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more.
Let's call her names, names for sure.
[Kanye West:]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up fuckin' and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other nigga's stroking you
Lying, say I hit you,
He sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud
Who's provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 A.M. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't your right girl
You probably find one of them "I like art"–type girls
All of her life, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Then who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game...
[John Legend:]
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
[Kanye West:]
"Things used to be, now they're not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely."
―Chloe Mitchell
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more.
Let's call out names, names, for sure.
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
And I know that you were somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just rang and rang
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing.
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing...
["The Best Birthday" Chris Rock:]
Oh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfucking level
Now a neighbourhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, God damn! Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you—you got damn disgusting,
My—my God, where—where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you motherfucking butt ass naked with them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level, this is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, OK. And I, and I love it.
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How d'you learn, how—how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I've never fucked before
I was in there like, "Oh, shit, I've never been here before." I've never even seen this part of pussy town before.
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy.
And when I see that nigga I'mma thank him.
I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker I'mma shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch. This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
Even with the bezel this is the motherfucker I wanted. I saw this shit, I saw that Twista had this shit on in The Source. I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well. 


"Lost In The World"
(feat. Justin Vernon of Bon Iver)

[Sample From "Woods": Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
[2x]
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night
[Kanye West:]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life,
Let's break out of this fake ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each other's arms still get laid
(I'm lost in the world)
Run from the lights, run from the night,
(I'm down on my mind)
Run for your life,
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life,
I'm new in the city but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city and I'm goin' for a ride
Goin' for a ride
I'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life
I'm new in the city but I'm down the for the night
Down for a night, down for a good time
[Gil-Scott Heron:]
Us living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal.
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling in the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And our children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? 


"On Sight"

[Verse 1:]
Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
The monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)
[Hook:]
On sight
On sight
How much you wanna give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
[Bridge:]
He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want
[Verse 2:]
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don't judge 'em Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the bleau she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth
[Hook:]
On sight
On sight
[Outro:]
Ugh, huh
Right now, right now
I need, I need
Right now


"Black Skinhead"

For my theme song, my leather black jeans on
My by any means on, pardon I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom but watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in, came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking. Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would have been blacked out on your ass
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
Stop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit, fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf, soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king, back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room bitch, stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit, them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
(Ready, ready for action)
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we're livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

"I Am A God"

[Intro: Capleton]
Blazing, mi don't want them
Mi need them
Blazing
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt

[Intro]
I am a god
I am a god

[Hook]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage

Even though I'm a man of god
My whole life in the hands of god
So y'all better quit playing with god
[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ivan, diamond, Chi-town shining
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chilling
Trying to stack these millions."
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's that cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm giving up. I'm a god 


"New Slaves"

[Verse 1:]
My momma was raised in an era when,
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And there's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come here, please buy more"
What you want a Bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves
[Hook:]
You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
[Verse 2:]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm about to wild the fuck out
I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that private owned prison
Get your piece today
They Probably all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout their maid
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now? 


"Hold My Liquor"
(feat. Chief Keef & Justin Vernon)

[Justin Vernon:]
I can hold my liquor
What this man can't handle is me
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
[Chief Keef:]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
[Kanye West:]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma, waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover, slightly scratch your Corolla
OK, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over, ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own you, one more fuck and I can own you
One cold night in October, pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra, pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over,
Yeezy's all on your sofa, these the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover,
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus, bitch you don't even know us
Baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner
Late-night organ donor, after that he disown you
After that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
And, bitch, I'm back out my coma
Calling up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
[Justin Vernon and Kanye West:]
I heard you need a new fad (a new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (a new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (a new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (a new girl)
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home 


"I'm In It"
(feat. Justin Vernon)

[Kanye West:]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off
[Assassin:]
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting a-dat man do
Action ting, yo, a badman ting
I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way José
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We a gon' smile 'pon court day
Becuh we beat murder charge like O.J
[Kanye West & (Justin Vernon):]
That's right, I'm in it
(Should've known I would fall)
I'm in it
(Steppin' on cracks on the floor)
That's right
(And your boys at your door)
That's right, I'm in it
(Well, you need to fight for your own)
That's right, I'm in it
(Then don't let me at your table)
I'm in it
(If you just gonna lay there)
Damn right
(Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars)
(I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes)
[Kanye West:]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now

"Blood On The Leaves"
(feat. Tony Williams)

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Breeze
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
Breeze
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Blood on the leaves
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Breeze
Yeah I told you to wait
Breeze
So I'mma need a little more time now
Blood on the leaves
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Breeze
Yeah, I thought you could wait
Breeze
These bitches surroundin' me
Black bodies
All want somethin' out me
Swinging in the southern breeze
Then they talk about me
Breeze
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Strange fruit hanging
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
From the poplar trees
Now I know you naughty
From the poplar trees
So let's get on with it
We could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Black bodies
Before the glory
Swinging in the southern breeze
Breeze
I know there ain't wrong with me
Strange fruit hanging
Something strange's happening
From the poplar trees
From the poplar trees
You could've been somebody
We could've, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the Nola
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Black bodies
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Swinging in the southern breeze
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Breeze
I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees
To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside
Wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated
I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony
She got you homie
'Til death but do your part
Unholy matrimony
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees
Breeze breeze
Blood on the leaves
Breeze breeze
Blood on the leaves
Breeze breeze
And breeze
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees
Breeze breeze
Blood on the leaves
Breeze breeze
Blood on the leaves
Breeze breeze 


"Guilt Trip"
(feat. Kid Cudi)

[Intro:]
I need to call it off, I need to make it known
'Nother one, something gone, Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn, fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life, I'm living mine
[Bridge:]
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
[Verse:]
Maybe it's cause she into Leos
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
Better bring your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka-blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka
[Bridge: Popcaan]
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop, chop chop
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK
[Hook:]
In my mind, in my, in my mind
In my mind, mind, mind, mind
In my mind, in my, in my mind
In my mind, mind, mind, mind
In my mind, in my, in my mind
Mind, mind, mind
[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Ohh
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go
[Hook:]
In my mind, in my, in my mind
In my mind, mind, mind, mind

"Send It Up"
(feat. King L)

[King Louie:]
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
[Kanye West:]
This the greatest shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again
[King Louie:]
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
[Beenie Man:]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have 


"Bound 2"
(feat. Charlie Wilson)

[Hook:]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
[Bridge:]
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown
Bound
[Hook:]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
[Verse 1:]
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turned the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch
[Charlie Wilson:]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
[Kanye West:]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound
[Hook:]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
[Verse 2:]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
[Charlie Wilson:]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
[Kanye West:]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound
[Hook:]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith
[Kelly Price (Choir):]
So why send depression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? More
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong to save
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light, Lord
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light
[Chance The Rapper:]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil Chano from 79th
[Kanye West:]
We on an ultralight beam

This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything
[The-Dream (Natalie Is Great) & Choir:]

Yes, Jesus
That's it
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
[Kirk Franklin & Choir:]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough.
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up.
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times.
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again. That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good

Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke

'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks

"Low Lights"

You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me.
I don't know what to tell you about him,
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me.
Every morning, every day of my life.
I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day.
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he...
he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will.
I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name.
Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there,
with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to.
I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.

"I Love Kanye"

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye?"
Man that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye 


"Waves"
(feat. Chris Brown)

Turn it up!
[Kanye West:]
Step up in this bitch like (turn it up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin' on my dick like
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave
[Chris Brown:]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby

Baby I don't, I don't need to own...
[Kanye West:]
Sun don't shine in the shade (turn it up!)
Bird can't fly in a cage (turn it up!)
Even when somebody go away (turn it up!)
The feelings don't really go away
That's just the wave (yeah)
[Chris Brown:]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment

"FML"
(feat. The Weeknd)

[Kanye West:]
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
[The Weeknd:]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Kanye West:]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have the laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...
[The Weeknd:]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Section 25 & Kanye West:]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Oh, life's a feeling
Oh, the body's a feeling


"Real Friends"
(feat. Ty Dolla $ign)

[Kanye West:]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you're not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...
[Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign:]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, oh you good?"
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him  


"Wolves"
(feat. Vic Mensa, Sia, Caroline Shaw)

[Kanye West:]
Lost and beat up
Dancin' down there
I found you somewhere out
Right 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there
Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Got to love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found out
[Vic Mensa:]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
[Sia:]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me in your gaze
Oh I found me, or Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
And I need you now
Lost and found out
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin'
Before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves."
"What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
Yes she was
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves." 


"Frank's Track"
(performed by Frank Ocean)

The rings all ring out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out 


"Siiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer Intermission"
(feat. Max B)

[Max B:]

"30 Hours"
(feat. André 3000)

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale Ándale E.I, E.I, uh, oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job
And I drove back 30 hours
Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh
[with André 3000:]

Yeah, this the type of shit you ride out to

"No More Parties In LA"
(feat. Kendrick Lamar)

[Junie Morrison:]
La di da di da, da
I like this flavor
La di da di da, la
Let me tell you
I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
[Kanye West:]
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
[Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West:]
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Ladies say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
[Kanye West:]
Scary
Scary
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use their kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content of slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I ain't never drive it
It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
[Larry Graham:]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place
[Kanye West:]
Please, no more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more (Los Angeles)
[Junie Morrison:]
I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
SWISH

Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?

You don't even know
I've been so far gone
I feel it
I've been so led on
I've been runnin' 'round
I feel it
I've been on my shit
Whole world on my dick
I feel it
I just need to know
I can feel it
[Ms. Barbara Tucker & Rare Earth:]
Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside

Oh, deep inside
Oh, I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside

Yes, deep inside
Oh, I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside

"Saint Pablo"
(feat. Sampha)

[Kanye West:]
Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit
[Kanye West:]
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spending
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Grow conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
[Sampha:]
And you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Are we looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Father, father, father
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby
[Kanye West:]
I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share they truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a cheque-book
But buy a new car, talking 'bout how my neck look?
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people, real
I've awoken from an enlightened man's dream
Checking Instagram comments to crowd-source my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I turned on the news and they was burying me
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'mma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with an off-the-wall flow
[Sampha:]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
[Sampha:]
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
[Sampha:]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me something before you leave
You've been treating me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you, oh, the invisible truths
Stay sober
I don't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standing under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
While I'm crying at the bar
I'm wishing that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishing that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above
[Sampha:]
And you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Are we looking at the church in the night sky?
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Father, father, father
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Are we looking at the church in the night sky?
Father, father, father
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
